ID: business_meeting_negotiation_001_turn_3
File: scenarios/business_meeting_negotiation_001/turn_3.mp3

That's a bit higher than we were hoping. Our current supplier offers similar specs at €26,000. Can you match that?

The warranty is appealing. If we commit to 20 units this year, what's the best you can do?
