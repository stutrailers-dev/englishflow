airport_security_001_turn_5,scenarios/airport_security_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"Ah yes, it's a power bank. That's fine. You're all clear. Have a good flight."

business_meeting_001_turn_5,scenarios/business_meeting_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"That's interesting. What's the drum rotation speed, and what kind of discharge rate can we expect?"
business_meeting_001_turn_7,scenarios/business_meeting_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"Very good. And what about the hydraulic system? Is it compatible with standard European truck connections?"

small_talk_001_turn_1,scenarios/small_talk_001/turn_1.mp3,scenario,"Bit grey today, isn't it? Typical British weather, I'm afraid. Is it very different in Turkey?"
small_talk_001_turn_3,scenarios/small_talk_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"I've always wanted to visit Turkey. Any plans for the weekend while you're here?"

phone_call_001_turn_5,scenarios/phone_call_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"Tuesday the 17th looks good. Would 10 o'clock work? We'll need about two hours, I imagine."
phone_call_001_turn_7,scenarios/phone_call_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"Excellent. I'll send you a calendar invite and directions to our office. Is there anything you'll need for the presentation?"

business_meeting_negotiation_001_turn_1,scenarios/business_meeting_negotiation_001/turn_1.mp3,scenario,"So, let's talk numbers. What kind of pricing are we looking at for a bulk order of curtainsiders?"
business_meeting_negotiation_001_turn_3,scenarios/business_meeting_negotiation_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"That's a bit higher than we were hoping. Our current supplier offers similar specs at €26,000. Can you match that?"
business_meeting_negotiation_001_turn_5,scenarios/business_meeting_negotiation_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"The warranty is appealing. If we commit to 20 units this year, what's the best you can do?"
business_meeting_negotiation_001_turn_7,scenarios/business_meeting_negotiation_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"That sounds reasonable. And what about payment terms? We typically work on 60-day terms."
business_meeting_negotiation_001_turn_9,scenarios/business_meeting_negotiation_001/turn_9.mp3,scenario,"That works for us. Shall we put together a formal proposal then?"

phone_complaint_001_turn_3,scenarios/phone_complaint_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"Let me pull that up... Yes, I can see it here. It looks like there was a delay at our warehouse. I'm sorry about that. It's scheduled to ship today."
phone_complaint_001_turn_5,scenarios/phone_complaint_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"I completely understand. Would express shipping help? We could upgrade to next-day delivery at no extra cost to make up for the delay."

factory_quality_001_turn_5,scenarios/factory_quality_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"I noticed you use both robotic and manual welding. How do you ensure consistent weld quality across both methods?"
factory_quality_001_turn_7,scenarios/factory_quality_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"Very thorough. One last question - what's your defect rate, and how has it trended over the past year?"
small_talk_networking_001_turn_1,scenarios/small_talk_networking_001/turn_1.mp3,scenario,"Quite a busy show this year, isn't it? I don't think we've met. I'm James, from Axle Solutions."
small_talk_networking_001_turn_3,scenarios/small_talk_networking_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"Turkey! Interesting. The Turkish trailer industry has grown enormously. What type of trailers do you specialise in?"
small_talk_networking_001_turn_5,scenarios/small_talk_networking_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"We supply axles and suspension systems to trailer manufacturers. Actually, we might be able to work together. Do you source your axles locally or import them?"
small_talk_networking_001_turn_7,scenarios/small_talk_networking_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"We distribute BPW and SAF-Holland. Look, I'd love to chat more, but I need to get back to the stand. Could I give you my card?"
technical_presentation_specs_001_turn_1,scenarios/technical_presentation_specs_001/turn_1.mp3,scenario,"Right, so tell me about this tipper. We need something robust for aggregate transport. What's the body capacity?"
technical_presentation_specs_001_turn_3,scenarios/technical_presentation_specs_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"Hardox is good. What about the tipping mechanism? We've had issues with slow tipping times in the past."
technical_presentation_specs_001_turn_5,scenarios/technical_presentation_specs_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"That's decent. What's the unladen weight? We need to maximise payload."
technical_presentation_specs_001_turn_7,scenarios/technical_presentation_specs_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"Good payload. One more thing - what warranty do you offer, and do you have service support in the UK?"
airport_taxi_001_turn_1,scenarios/airport_taxi_001/turn_1.mp3,scenario,"Hello there! Where can I take you today?"
airport_taxi_001_turn_3,scenarios/airport_taxi_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"The Grand Hotel, yes I know it well. That'll be about 25 pounds. Should take around 20 minutes depending on traffic. Is that alright?"
airport_taxi_001_turn_5,scenarios/airport_taxi_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"Yes, card is fine. So, business or pleasure? You sound like you've travelled a fair way."
airport_taxi_001_turn_7,scenarios/airport_taxi_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"Turkey, lovely! Right, here we are - the Grand Hotel. That's 24 pounds on the meter. Shall I get your bag from the boot?"

hotel_checkout_001_turn_5,scenarios/hotel_checkout_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"Of course. Let me check... You're right, that was a system error. I'll remove it. The new total is £467. How would you like to pay?"
hotel_checkout_001_turn_7,scenarios/hotel_checkout_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"Certainly. Here's your receipt. Is there anything else I can help with? Do you need transport to the airport?"

business_meeting_followup_001_turn_3,scenarios/business_meeting_followup_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"Good to hear. We did have one concern though - your quality manager mentioned there was a weld issue on a previous batch. Has that been addressed?"
business_meeting_followup_001_turn_5,scenarios/business_meeting_followup_001/turn_5.mp3,scenario,"That's reassuring. Now, regarding delivery - we're a bit concerned about the timeline. Can you still hit the March 15th deadline?"
business_meeting_followup_001_turn_7,scenarios/business_meeting_followup_001/turn_7.mp3,scenario,"Excellent. One more thing - we're considering increasing next quarter's order to 25 units. Would that be feasible for you?"
restaurant_bill_001_turn_1,scenarios/restaurant_bill_001/turn_1.mp3,scenario,"That was a lovely meal. Shall we get the bill?"

technical_presentation_qa_001_turn_3,scenarios/technical_presentation_qa_001/turn_3.mp3,scenario,"Good to know. Another question - what's the typical lifespan of your trailer floors? We've had issues with rotting on other brands."
